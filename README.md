## Project description
The main objective was to develop a scalable and interactive interface to visualise the 5G performance in the city of Brimbank.
Our visual interface has the following features
* Use-case 1. Display and compare different 5G performance parameters for different geographical locations and time.
* Use-case 2. Display and compare different 5G performance aggregated at the suburb level.
* Use-case 3. Highlight the correlation between truck speed with the 5G performance.
* Use-case 4. Explore the correlation between weather conditions, including rain levels, wind speeds and cloud levels with the 5G performance.
* Use-case 5. Explore how the 5G performance varies at different hours in a day.
